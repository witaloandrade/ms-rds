>>>> Now comes the question, what if we have users that need to connect to RDS farm using built-in RDP client?
Copy the loadbalanceinfo setting from rdp file download from RD Web Access
Next open the regedit on the RD Broker and browse to

HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\ClusterSettings and create a new registry setting Name: DefaultTsvUrl
REG_SZ and paste in the value from rdp file

>>>>Next thing we need to configure is the RemoteApps and Full Desktop on the same session host.

On your connection broker run regedit and browse to HKLM\ SOFTWARE\ Microsoft\ Windows NT\ CurrentVersion\ Terminal Server\ CentralPublishedResources\ PublishedFarms\ collection\ RemoteDesktops\ collection

Change registry setting ShowInPortal from 0 to 1

>>>>The last thing we need to configure is the RemoteApp log off settings
To accomplish this we need to configure session time limit GP setting on the Session Host server, which is under Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Session Time Limits
